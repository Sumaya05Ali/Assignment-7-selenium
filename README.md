    cd Assignment-7-selenium-main 
   ```
   
2.  Install the required dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
      
3. Run the test cases:
   ```bash
      python test_cases.py
     ```
   
4. Run the currency test:
  ```bash
      python currency_test.py
   ```

5.  Run the data scraping script:
     ```bash
        python scrape_data_test.py
    ```
## Output
- An Excel report is generated in the reports folder named test_report.xlsx.
- The main sheet records the results of the SEO-related test cases (H1 tags, alt attributes, etc.), while the second sheet contains URL status checks.
- Data scraped from the page scripts (CampaignID, SiteName, etc.) is added to a separate sheet named Scraped Data and also currency filtering test report is added to another sheet named Currency Test.

## Test Details
- H1 Tag Existence: Checks if the H1 tag is present on the page. A missing H1 tag is reported as a failure.
- HTML Tag Sequence Test: Validates that all heading tags from H1 to H6 are present and follow the correct sequence. Any missing tag is reported.
- Image Alt Attribute Test: Ensures all images on the page have alt attributes. Missing attributes are flagged as failures.
- URL Status Code Test: Checks all URLs on the page for their status. If a URL returns a 404 (Not Found), it is reported as a failure.
- Currency Filter Test: Validates that the currency changes on the property tiles when selecting different currencies.
- Data Scraping from Scripts: Extracts specific data (CampaignID, SiteName, etc.) from the pageâ€™s script tags and saves it to the Excel file.
